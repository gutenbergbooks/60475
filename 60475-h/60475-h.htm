<p class="caption">This is Peggy&#8217;s own drawing of what happened in the first
Adventure of the Ring. Everyone is very frightened in it.
Nurse has just sat down on seeing the Giant, and has
dropped Peggy&#8217;s brown holland frock behind her.<br />

Peggy drew the frock very carefully, spreading it out
flat on the floor to get it exactly right. Mother helped her
with the Giant&#8217;s knee, and with the table. All the rest she
did herself. She knows Nurse is too small, but she was too
busy getting her surprised enough to remember to make
her bigger. Peggy is behind the Giant wondering what
to say. The little round things near the Giant&#8217;s foot are
the broken bits of the cup and saucer, and the black
dots are the currants in the cake. The curls in the Giant&#8217;s
beard were the most fun to do.</p>

<p class="ph1">PEGGY&#8217;S GIANT</p>


<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />

<small>WHAT PEGGY FOUND</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;It</span> rattles!&#8221; said Peggy, shaking the last cracker, and
looking up at Nurse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, pull it now, there&#8217;s a dear,&#8221; said Nurse, &#8220;and let
me clear up this litter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy had just finished her birthday tea up in the
nursery alone with Nurse, as Mother was away. Of course
it hadn&#8217;t been nearly so exciting as her last birthday tea&mdash;the
only one she could remember&mdash;which had been downstairs
with lots of other little girls and boys, who had all come to
see Peggy. They hadn&#8217;t talked to her or to each other
much, but had eaten lots of birthday cake, and Peggy had
been taken up to bed before the last of them left, because
she had had such a long and exciting birthday.</p>

<p>This year the only children who could come had
suddenly started whooping-cough, and so there was no party
at all. Still it was better than the usual dull nursery tea,
for Mother had left a lot of crackers with Nurse for Peggy;
and Cook had remembered to put six new candles on the
new sponge cake, and they had all been lighted, and were
doing their very best to look brighter than the sunshine
pouring in through the nursery windows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do guess what&#8217;s inside first, Nannie,&#8221; said Peggy,
shaking the cracker again. &#8220;<i>I</i> guess it&#8217;s a little tiny cup
and saucer for my doll&#8217;s house. Now, <i>you</i> guess.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, <i>I</i> don&#8217;t know&mdash;a whistle,&#8221; said Nannie, beginning
to clear up the pieces of brightly-coloured paper that covered
the table-cloth and floor, and that really looked a great deal
too pretty to burn. &#8220;That&#8217;s generally what it is. But
what&#8217;s the good of guessing when you&#8217;ll know in a minute?
Come along and pull, I&#8217;m waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy shut her eyes, and putting one hand over her ear&mdash;she
was always uncomfortably startled by the bang&mdash;pulled
hard with the other.</p>

<p>The thing inside immediately flew through the air, and
rolled away under the toy cupboard. And Peggy followed
as far as she could, lying flat on the floor and peering
under. Then&mdash;&#8220;O Nannie, it sparkles!&#8221; she cried
excitedly. &#8220;I do believe it&#8217;s a <i>beautiful</i> ring! I can see
it quite plainly. Yes, it <i>is</i>. It&#8217;s a gold ring with a great
big green stone in it! There, I&#8217;ve got it! O Nannie,
look how it sparkles!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A bit of tin and glass,&#8221; said Nurse examining it and
dropping it on the table. &#8220;What they want to put such
rubbish in for passes <i>my</i> understanding! You can&#8217;t play
with it, and it&#8217;ll only get left about. Now come and look at
the paper blazing,&#8221; and she swept all the ends of the crackers
into the fire.</p>

<p>Peggy was terrified that her ring would follow too, and
she began in a great hurry to put it on all her fingers in turn
to see which it would fit.</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t fit any of them except my fum,&#8221; she remarked.
&#8220;But just look how <i>well</i> it fits my fum!&#8221; and she waved her
left hand to and fro proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t wear a ring at <i>your</i> age,&#8221; said Nurse
decidedly, &#8220;and no one ever wears them on their thumbs,
as you very well know. Oh dear, your hair ribbon&#8217;s coming
right off, as usual! Come here whilst I tie it on again.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>&#8220;Just look how it sparkles!&#8221; repeated Peggy, stroking
the green stone admiringly. And it certainly did. A bright
green light spread from it all over that part of the nursery,
just like the light in a beech wood in spring, when the sun
is shining through the leaves; and it coloured and played
over Nurse&#8217;s face and the cupboard and the roses on the
wall-paper. &#8220;<i>Do</i> look, Nannie,&#8221; cried the child, &#8220;now the
fireplace is green!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very pretty,&#8221; said Nurse absentmindedly, not looking
up as she brushed Peggy&#8217;s curls. &#8220;What a tangle your
hair&#8217;s in, to be sure! Now I think I&#8217;ll take off this clean
frock and put on your brown holland so that you can have a
good game with all your toys out at once, as it&#8217;s your
birthday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to play with me, too?&#8221; asked Peggy
rather wistfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Nurse. &#8220;I&#8217;ve some letters to write, and
post goes in half an hour&mdash;when it&#8217;ll be your bedtime.
Grown-ups can&#8217;t spend <i>all</i> their time playing with little girls,
you know. Here, slip your frock off and stay by the
fire, whilst I fetch in your other,&#8221; and she bustled off into
the night-nursery.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I was grown up,&#8221; said Peggy, twirling the ring
round and round her thumb and staring into the fire.
&#8220;Then I should drink strong tea, and eat birthday cake
downstairs every day if I liked, and wear grand hats with
fevvers in them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready whenever you are,&#8221; said a voice behind her.</p>

<p>Peggy turned round quickly, and then nearly jumped
out of her skin with astonishment.</p>

<p>For behind her, on the other side of the table, stood a
Giant!</p>

<p>Peggy knew in a moment that he <i>was</i> a real Giant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
because he was the living image of the one on page 375 of the
Blue Fairy Book, but instead of looking cross like that one
does, he had a nice wide smile, and the kindest round
twinkly blue eyes Peggy had ever seen. He was dressed all in
brown, with bright scarlet stockings, his hair was thick and
long, and so was his beard, and the nursery was so much too
low for him that he had to bend nearly double, his great
shoulders sending a cloud of plaster off the ceiling every
time he moved. In one huge hand he held a cup of very
black-looking tea, and in the other a bit of birthday cake
with sugar on it and almond paste and little silver beads.</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> a tall kind!&#8221; gasped Peggy, staring up at him.
&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t think Nannie will be at all pleased!&#8221; and she
glanced fearfully through the half-open door into the night-nursery.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, that&#8217;s why I spoke,&#8221; said the Giant, sitting
down on the floor and stretching himself&mdash;one foot went
right out of the window in the process, and the other up the
chimney, but he looked much more comfortable. The cup of
tea and the cake he put carefully down by his side. &#8220;You
rubbed the ring and wished, you know. How do you like
your dress?&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy looked down at herself and discovered she was
wearing a striped white and yellow silk gown falling in
heavy folds to the ground, and very high-waisted. On her
arm was hanging, by its ribbon, a large white poke-bonnet,
wreathed entirely around with a curling yellow feather.</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>are</i> these things?&#8221; she asked in bewilderment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you wished to be grown up, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; said the
Giant. &#8220;And you <i>are</i>. Or, at least, that&#8217;s the best I can do
for you. But I&#8217;m a bit out of practice I know,&#8221; and he
gazed with a rather disheartened air at the bonnet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what Nannie will say,&#8221; said Peggy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
uneasily. (She hadn&#8217;t the heart to tell the Giant that
he hadn&#8217;t made her in the least the kind of grown-up she
wanted to be.) &#8220;She <i>never</i> likes me dressing up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, wish about it,&#8221; said the Giant. &#8220;Say, &#8216;I
wish Nurse to stay away half an hour.&#8217; Hurry up, she&#8217;s
coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish Nurse to stay away half an hour,&#8221; said Peggy
obediently. &#8220;But what&#8217;s the good of that?&#8221; she added.
&#8220;Here she is,&#8221; and so she was.</p>

<p>She came through the door hurriedly, with the frock in
her hand, and when she saw the Giant she jumped right up
high into the air, and then she sat down on the floor with a
flop.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Who</i> is this, Miss Peggy?&#8221; she asked in an awful voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; said the Giant, struggling to his feet and
knocking over the Rocking-Horse and three chairs in his
hurry. &#8220;What <i>can</i> have gone wrong? The spells don&#8217;t
work as they used to!&#8221; He looked at Nurse nervously;
then&mdash;&#8220;You must stick to me,&#8221; he whispered hoarsely to
Peggy, stepping back on the cup and saucer and grinding
them to powder with his heel.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />

<small>DISAPPEARING</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;He&#8217;s</span>&mdash;he&#8217;s a friend of mine!&#8221; said Peggy bravely. She
suddenly felt very sorry for the Giant, for though he was so
extremely big he seemed somehow now just like a helpless
baby. &#8220;He&#8217;s come to tea, Nannie, because it&#8217;s my birfday.&#8221;
(Peggy still talked baby language when she got excited.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
&#8220;And he&#8217;s brought a lovely bit of cake like you said people
had before the War,&#8221; she went on, pressing the ring tightly,
and wondering when Nurse <i>would</i> speak. But the
unfortunate woman continued to sit on the floor, glaring
wildly at the Giant, and opening and shutting her mouth
without a sound coming out of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear, <i>I wish</i> something would happen,&#8221; at last came
from Peggy desperately.</p>

<p>No sooner were the words out of her mouth than she
felt the Giant tuck her under his arm and walk straight out
of the window with her!</p>

<p>They went right over the garden and fields, the Giant
striding along through the air with the greatest ease, and
at such a pace that often the birds they met had no time to
fly out of their way, and flew full tilt against them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phew! that <i>was</i> a narrow shave!&#8221; said the Giant,
stepping down at last into the middle of a great wood. He
put Peggy down on some soft green moss, and leant against
an oak tree, panting. &#8220;And after all, we left the tea and cake
behind!&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Peggy looked up at him. His head was right up above
the branches, but she could see his long brown beard among
the twigs.</p>

<p>&#8220;You squashed them both with your foot,&#8221; she said
plaintively. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t understand <i>anyfing</i>! Why did
you come at all? Though I like you very much,&#8221; she continued
quickly. And indeed she had, from the very first moment.
For he had such a kind face&mdash;though it was not what you
would call a clever one exactly&mdash;and he was so different
from every one else, and looked as though he would play
games nicely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came because you wished,&#8221; said the Giant. &#8220;That&#8217;s
a Fairy Ring, that is. But it&#8217;s not once in a hundred years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
any children find it&mdash;or, when they do, think of putting it on
their thumb and wishing. By the way, where was it this
time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a cracker,&#8221; said Peggy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I know those crackers,&#8221; said the Giant. &#8220;One
Fairy one to ten million common ones is the average. Let
me congratulate you! You&#8217;ll be allowed six visits from me,
and six wishes each time, before the Ring disappears again.
Very liberal, I call it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean you can let me have everything I wish
for, like what happens in the Fairy stories?&#8221; asked Peggy
in a state of great excitement, and she began to jump about in
a very un-grown-up way. &#8220;Oh, I wish&mdash;I wish this tree was
made of chocolate!&#8221; she screamed. (You must remember
she was rather over-excited, as it was her birthday.)</p>

<p>The Giant immediately handed her down a chocolate
cream from one of the boughs; and Peggy noticed a bright
shade of brown creeping all over the trunk and branches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wish number three gone,&#8221; said the Giant with a sigh
of relief. &#8220;Thank goodness, <i>that</i> wasn&#8217;t difficult. But I&#8217;m
sorry to tell you I&#8217;ve grown rusty, very rusty indeed! It&#8217;s
so many years since I&#8217;ve had anything of this sort to do, that
I&#8217;ve forgotten how to manage the simplest things.&#8221; He sighed
deeply till the branches clashed together over Peggy&#8217;s head.
&#8220;I can see by your eye,&#8221; he went on gloomily, &#8220;that there&#8217;s
something not quite up to date enough about your dress.
And you must have noticed in the nursery that I&#8217;d quite
forgotten how to disappear quickly. I shall lose my nerve
at this rate, I know I shall!&#8221; and a large tear dropped
at Peggy&#8217;s feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, you won&#8217;t!&#8221; said Peggy, putting her arms as far
round one of his ankles as they would go, and hugging it.
(The chocolate cream had been delicious, and she was in very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
good spirits.) &#8220;I&#8217;d have hated you to disappear without me
just now! Nannie would have been angry <i>anyhow</i> at my
dress&mdash;and you managed beautifully after! But you shall
practise disappearing now if you want to. We&#8217;ve lots of
time, haven&#8217;t we? Go on. Try.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the Giant tried and tried&mdash;and then he rested&mdash;and
then he tried and tried again, but it wasn&#8217;t the slightest
good; he remained just as big and brown and <i>there</i> as ever.
At last, with a stupendous effort, he almost succeeded, though
he still showed a bit where the sun shone down against the
trunk, whilst one of his huge boots remained quite visible,
standing forlornly on the grass beside Peggy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no good,&#8221; he remarked, reappearing again with
startling suddenness. &#8220;<i>There</i>, I&#8217;m back again, you see, and I
didn&#8217;t mean to be. <i>Do</i> use one of your wishes on it! Perhaps
if I&#8217;d only disappeared once in the proper way, I should
get into the hang of it all again. You&#8217;d better turn the
Ring besides wishing, to make it more certain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy did so, giving the Ring an extra turn in her
zeal, and the Giant rolled completely up, and disappeared
in a twinkling, to her great satisfaction. &#8220;That was
<i>splendid</i>!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You see it was quite easy! Now
come back and do it again by yourself&#8221;&mdash;but the Giant
didn&#8217;t answer at all.</p>

<p>A little cold wind blew right through the wood and
rustled all the chocolate oak leaves above Peggy&#8217;s head,
and a squirrel up in the branches threw a chocolate cream
down on her, and then another, and they both squashed on
her striped silk dress. Peggy was not easily frightened,
but it all felt very lonely and queer, particularly as she
didn&#8217;t know in the least where she was. She jumped to
her feet and began running about the wood, shouting for
the Giant as loudly as she could.</p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>It was only when she had been doing this for quite
a long time, and getting no answer at all, that she
remembered that she had not wished or turned the Ring.
She at once did both, and, &#8220;<i>Don&#8217;t</i> tread on me for goodness&#8217;
sake!&#8221; said a squeaky voice near her foot.</p>

<p>Peggy looked down, and there amongst the leaves
stood a tiny little figure reaching no higher than her instep.
It was only when she had picked him up and peered closely
into his face that she recognised the features of the Giant,
distorted with rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;what <i>has</i> happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should learn to manage your Ring better, before
you treat me like this!&#8221; said the tiny Giant in an
exceedingly cross voice. &#8220;Put me on a blade of grass at
once, please,&mdash;thank you. I don&#8217;t like being held round
the middle like that. Why did you turn the Ring more than
once? I&#8217;ve never disappeared so uncomfortably fast before.
And now look at the size I am! This is all I can manage
after such a shock!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s not my fault,&#8221; said Peggy with some spirit.
&#8220;You ought to know the Ring better than I do. I only did
what you told me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have got a broad outline of how the thing should be
run,&#8221; said the Giant. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t fill in the details. You
will have to learn by experience, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What grand words you use,&#8221; said Peggy respectfully,
but the Giant didn&#8217;t look mollified at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ve used up the five wishes (not counting the
failure) so you&#8217;d better wish yourself back in the nursery,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see that you&#8217;ve had much fun, and I
know I haven&#8217;t. Goodness knows how I shall get back to <i>my</i>
house!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but I want to do lots more,&#8221; said Peggy. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
haven&#8217;t played at being grown up at all yet, and I haven&#8217;t
had any more chocolates!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, there&#8217;s no time left&mdash;wish yourself home,&#8221;
said the Giant. &#8220;Quick, now!&#8221;</p>

<p>He sounded so like Nurse at her crossest that Peggy
hurriedly obeyed,&mdash;and the next instant she found herself
standing alone in the nursery in her petticoat, and in the
act of putting her ring into the toy cupboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be cold!&#8221; said Nurse, coming in. &#8220;I thought
I&#8217;d never find your old frock, and leaning over the drawer
made me feel quite faint-like! There! now have a nice
game with your dolls,&#8221; and she bustled over to draw the
curtain.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the same I wish he hadn&#8217;t seemed so cross,&#8221; said
Peggy to her Golliwog. &#8220;The only really nice part was the
chocolate cream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>are</i> you grumbling about?&#8221; asked Nurse. &#8220;A
chocolate cream, indeed, at this time of night! I think, if
you ask me, that it&#8217;s time all little girls were in bed!&#8221; (She
was <i>that</i> sort of Nurse.)</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Peggy, jumping up at once. She even
began to unbutton her frock and pull off her hair ribbon to
Nurse&#8217;s great surprise; who, of course, couldn&#8217;t know that
all Peggy wanted was for the next day to come quickly, so
that she could see the Giant again.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll really find out the right way to manage the
wishing to-morrow,&#8221; she thought as she cuddled down into
bed. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t the dear old Giant&#8217;s fault if he&#8217;s forgotten
things a little bit. It was really very clever of him to think
of that dress at all! It&#8217;s the sort great-great-grandmother
is wearing in the picture in the hall. Perhaps she was one
of the little girls he played with. Fancy him remembering
all that time ago, clever old thing!&#8221; She turned her head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and stared up at the ceiling, all golden with the firelight,
and crossed with black crinkly bars from the reflection of
the guard. &#8220;All the same I wish he hadn&#8217;t looked so cross,&#8221;
she murmured, as she fell asleep.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />

<small>A DAISY FIELD</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Peggy</span> sat curled up on the big window seat in the nursery
reading <i>Mary&#8217;s Meadow</i>. At least, you couldn&#8217;t call it
exactly reading, but mother had read out bits to her so often
that she could remember most of them by heart.</p>

<p>Nurse was down in the kitchen talking to Cook; and
the rain was pelting against the window-panes and the
wind was blowing the trees all sideways and flattening
down the plants in the garden, and screaming round and
round the house trying to get in and blow Peggy about too.</p>

<p>Her little fat fingers moved along below the words as
she read to herself in a slow whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;We went there for flow-ers; we went there for
mush-rooms and puff-balls; we went there to hear the
night-in-gale.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy stopped, and looked out at the driving rain with
a little sigh. &#8220;I wish <i>I</i> had a meadow of my very own!&#8221;
she thought. And then she suddenly saw a bright green
light coming from the cupboard in front of her, and at
the same moment the Ring flew right through the wooden
door, and straight on to her thumb!</p>

<p>Peggy gave a little shout of delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I was in my meadow with my Giant,&#8221; she cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
as fast as she could, for she heard Nurse&#8217;s step on the stairs.
&#8220;And picking daisies, please,&#8221; she added, turning the Ring
round, and rubbing it too, so as to make quite certain lots
would happen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m perfectly delighted with this effect. My powers
are returning, it seems!&#8221; said the Giant, speaking in his
grandest though tiniest voice.</p>

<p>Peggy rubbed her eyes and tried to open them wide,
but the sunshine was so dazzling that for a few seconds
she was quite blinded by it.</p>

<p>Then she saw that she was in a great big green field,
edged all round with a tall green hedge; and growing
amongst the grass in the field were flowers, shaped like
daisies of every kind and colour, big ones, little ones, tall
ones, short ones, white, blue, pink, red, yellow, and purple
ones, and even some of colours Peggy had only thought
about sometimes but knew no name for. And the most
lovely scent&mdash;a sort of mixture of honey and roses and
pansies&mdash;came up from the whole field.</p>

<p>Peggy sat down amongst the flowers, clapping her
hands. This was something like a wish! But where was
the Giant?</p>

<p>&#8220;May I <i>really</i> pick a bunch?&#8221; she asked, looking
towards the place where she thought his voice had come
from.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, only be very careful of me!&#8221; said the Giant, and
Peggy felt something tickling her hand.</p>

<p>She looked down and saw the Giant.</p>

<p>He was still very tiny, and was balancing on the yellow
centre of a scarlet daisy, and reaching up to prick her hand
with a bit of tasselled grass. He had a most roguish and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
good-tempered expression on his little fat face, and the sun
shone down on his curly beard till it made it look quite
golden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what fun it must be to be small like that!&#8221; said
Peggy, clasping her hands (she was so pleased to find the
Giant wasn&#8217;t cross any longer). &#8220;I wish <i>I</i> could balance
on a daisy too!&#8221;</p>

<p>She at once found herself standing amongst some thick
bristling yellow stalks, like corn, whilst all around her
spread up curving blue walls, stretching, it seemed, right
up to the blue sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened? Where am I?&#8221; she asked in a
rather surprised voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Balancing on a blue daisy,&#8221; said the Giant, jumping
into the yellow stalks by her side. And Peggy noticed
that they were now both exactly the same height. &#8220;Look
out! Hold on!&#8221; he added excitedly, catching her hand.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a breeze passing over the flowers. We&#8217;re going
swinging!&#8221;</p>

<p>A great rustling sounded in the distance, which
suddenly burst into a roar as a great wind swept
by&mdash;and down they were flung on to the huge silky
walls as the daisy bowed its head. Then with a
tremendous jerk the flower righted itself, and sent them
spinning off on to another daisy. This one shook its
head and slid them on to another, and so on and on,
half across the field, until at last, when they had learnt
to balance, and were swinging dizzily to and fro on a
large violet-coloured petal, the whole thing tilted more
suddenly than usual, and shot them down on to the
ground below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, wasn&#8217;t it <i>lovely</i>!&#8221; cried Peggy, looking up through
the dim light at the gigantic heads, still swaying to and fro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
amongst the great blades of grass which looked as tall as
trees. &#8220;What fun it is to be tiny like this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting a bit tired of it,&#8221; said the Giant ruefully.
He had knocked his knee on a little stone, and was sitting
on the ground rubbing it. &#8220;You left me this size yesterday,
you know&mdash;and I couldn&#8217;t remember the way to get back to
my proper height! I think you&#8217;ll have to use up a wish on
me now. After all, you&#8217;ve got four left still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Peggy obediently. (Anything to keep
the Giant in such a good temper.) &#8220;I wish you were as tall
as you were before.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Giant immediately shot up right through the grass
and flowers, and apparently disappeared, for Peggy found
herself left by an enormous black rock which barred the
way, and quite shut out all the light there was in that dark
place. She at once began trying to climb it, so as to find her
way back to the Giant, but she had no sooner scrambled up
the first ledge, than a voice that filled the air like several
claps of thunder all sounding at once, bawled out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Get off my boot! I daren&#8217;t <i>move</i>. You can&#8217;t possibly
stay as small as that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear, it&#8217;s you I&#8217;m on, is it?&#8221; exclaimed Peggy. &#8220;I
quite forgot that I was left so tiny! Now I must use up
another wish, I suppose. What dreadful waste!&#8221; And of
course there was nothing for it but to do so, as you can&#8217;t
possibly have any fun with someone a million times taller
than yourself.</p>

<p>The next moment she was sitting among the flowers,
once more her proper size, with the Giant, once more <i>his</i>
proper size too, standing by her.</p>

<p>&#8220;And <i>now</i>, may I begin to pick a bunch for Mummie?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said the Giant. &#8220;There&#8217;s no one to stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
you; they&#8217;re all your own.&#8221; He sat down on a hedge near
by, which immediately sank with his weight, the trees that
grew on it toppling down in all directions. &#8220;There, now
I&#8217;m comfortable,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and I think I&#8217;ll have a nap. I
never slept a wink last night.&#8221; And he lay down across
what was left of the hedge, closed his eyes, and started
snoring at once.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>THE SLEEPY GIANT</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Poor</span> Giant,&#8221; said little Peggy, climbing up the hedge
to look down at his round, good-tempered face, and wide-open
mouth. &#8220;Sometimes he talks so grandly, but he&#8217;s not
a bit grand really. I&#8217;ll let him stay asleep for a nice long
time whilst I pick a huge, big bunch to send Mummie,&#8221; and
she jumped down into the field again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only two wishes left now,&#8221; she thought to herself,
as she ran in and out amongst the daisies. &#8220;Or really only
one that&#8217;s any good, for I suppose I must use the last to get
me home. I really think,&#8221; she went on, as she sat down to
tie a bit of grass round a bunch of scarlet daisies, &#8220;that the
Giant ought to get me home himself without making me
waste a wish on it! I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s always done in books.
I&#8217;ll speak to him about it when he wakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The running about in the hot sun had made Peggy quite
thirsty, and after some searching she found a dear little
stream running right through the field, at which a lot of
butterflies were drinking. It was a beautiful golden colour,
and when she tasted it she found it was the most delicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
lemonade, and it had crystallised rose leaves floating here and
there upon it. The butterflies flew round her in hundreds
and allowed her to stroke their soft red and blue and yellow
wings, and when she suggested a game of hide-and-seek they
were all delighted, and fluttered round in such quantities
that she could scarcely breathe.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus022.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">This is the picture Peggy drew of the Second Adventure.
It was a very difficult one to do. The Butterflies are just
coming up in hundreds and hundreds to try and wake
the Giant. Mother showed Peggy how to draw the butterflies,
but she did nearly all the rest quite by herself. The
Giant sometimes wore that red hat, and sometimes a green
pointed one. The Butterflies and Daisies were the most fun
to paint. I hope you see the Ring.</p>

<p>It turned out a failure in the end, as not one butterfly
could be induced to remain hidden long enough for the
others to find him, but was always flitting in and out of
his hiding-place, which, as everyone knows, completely
spoils hide-and-seek.</p>

<p>However, they had a lovely romp, and it was quite a
pretty sight to see several hundreds of them chasing Peggy
back to &#8220;Home&#8221; (which was the Giant&#8217;s boot) after she had
hidden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do let&#8217;s wake the Giant!&#8221; said Peggy, as they
stopped for breath, &#8220;and make him play too! I know he&#8217;d
love it!&#8221;</p>

<p>They all gathered round the sleeping Giant, who
was lying just as Peggy had left him, snoring loudly, with
his head comfortably pillowed amongst the spreading roots
of a fallen tree.</p>

<p>But do you think they could wake him? Not they!</p>

<p>Peggy climbed the hedge and tickled his face with a
branch. Then she tried to shake his arm, but of course
couldn&#8217;t move it at all. Then she begged the butterflies to
help, and they all flew round him with a great swishing of
wings, making as much noise as they possibly could;
but still the Giant lay there snoring, for he was not
used to being up a whole night long, and was very,
very tired.</p>

<p>A large blue and gold butterfly suggested pouring
lemonade on to his face, and they fetched a good deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
between them all, but that wasn&#8217;t the least good, and only
slid on to his beard and made it very wet and sticky.</p>




<p>&#8220;Oh, what <i>am</i> I to do?&#8221; cried Peggy. &#8220;It&#8217;s not fair! I
never heard of such a thing happening in any Fairy Book!
Nannie always lifts me out of bed when I won&#8217;t wake up. I
only wish she was here to do it to him!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then she could have bitten her tongue out, for the
butterflies suddenly wheeled round and flew away in a great
cloud, and &#8220;He <i>is</i> a heavy weight, Miss Peggy,&#8221; said Nurse,
appearing on the other side of the hedge, her face very red
and hot. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll manage it in a moment. Now then, up
with you! <i>There</i> he is, great heavy thing! He ought to
be ashamed of himself, the big baby!&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy felt dreadfully disappointed, and also rather
angry, for though she didn&#8217;t mind getting annoyed with the
Giant herself, it was a different thing hearing Nurse call
him names. And now she&#8217;d wasted another wish entirely by
accident, and must use her last up as quick as lightning, for
Nurse was already beginning to look very puzzled and
suspicious.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we were back in the nursery,&#8221; she whispered
to the Giant, who was sitting up on the hedge, rubbing his
eyes and staring at Nurse.... &#8220;And I&#8217;m very, very angry
with you!&#8221; she added, as she found herself on the nursery
window-seat again. But she was only answered by a rattle
of raindrops on the panes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve dropped your nice book on the floor,&#8221; said
Nurse, coming in with a pile of aired linen in her arms and
a deep frown on her face. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to go back to rag-books
again if you serve <i>Mary&#8217;s Meadow</i> like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear, I <i>quite</i> forgot the bunch of daisies!&#8221; said
Peggy, aghast.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>&#8220;Now <i>what</i> daisies, Miss Peggy?&#8221; asked Nurse. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
have you talking nonsense instead of attending to what I
say. Pick that book up immediately. And you&#8217;ve got that
Ring on your thumb again, I do declare! Mother wouldn&#8217;t
like it at all, nasty common thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mayn&#8217;t I wear it <i>sometimes</i>, Nannie?&#8221; Peggy pleaded.
&#8220;I <i>know</i> Mummie wouldn&#8217;t mind. She always lets me wear
the bead necklaces I make.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No arguing!&#8221; said Nurse. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to put it in this
cup on the bookshelf, and you can ask your mother when she
comes back. Time enough to wear it then if she&#8217;ll let you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She <i>did</i> seem cross. No wonder, for, though she didn&#8217;t
know it, she had just travelled very many million miles in
about three seconds, and that&#8217;s very upsetting to the temper
if you&#8217;re not used to it.</p>

<p>And Peggy looked sadly at the cup, for it was far out
of her reach even if she stood on a chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;d only had time to explain to the Giant!&#8221; she
thought. &#8220;<i>He</i> couldn&#8217;t help sleeping so soundly, poor
thing. Now perhaps I shall never see him again.&#8221; And
she was very subdued indeed for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>But she needn&#8217;t have worried. You see she kept on
forgetting it was a <i>Fairy</i> Ring.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>SWEETS AND FAIRIES</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;And</span> if you don&#8217;t get muddy, but pick your way nicely,
we&#8217;ll go to the village shop and buy a pennyworth of sweets,&#8221;
said Nurse the next day, when they started out for their
walk.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>&#8220;May I pick some primroses if I see them?&#8221; asked
Peggy, dancing along.</p>

<p>There never were any on the high road, where Nurse
generally chose to walk, but still there was always the
chance there <i>might</i> be one day, and it was well to get
permission beforehand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if you like,&#8221; said Nurse absentmindedly. She
was very busy trying to see into a cab that had just passed,
and didn&#8217;t really hear. Not that it mattered. There never
were any primroses.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one&mdash;at least I <i>fink</i> there is!&#8221; said Peggy
suddenly, when they had nearly reached the village. She
stood on the edge of the ditch and peered up into the hedge.
&#8220;Or is it a Fairy, perhaps? <i>Do</i> look, Nannie, it&#8217;s all white
and shiny!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A Fairy indeed!&#8221; said Nurse, looking up too. &#8220;It&#8217;s
an old bit of paper blown up there. Be careful, or you&#8217;ll be
in the ditch!&#8221;</p>

<p>But she was too late, for Peggy lost her balance&mdash;or the
side of the ditch gave way&mdash;and the next moment the two
little gaitered legs were half hidden in dark brown muddy
water!</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Very</i> good!&#8221; said Nurse in a terrible voice. Then
she dragged Peggy out, and walked her back along the
road towards home, saying nothing in her most alarming
manner.</p>

<p>Peggy really felt quite frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nannie, you&#8217;re hurting my arm!&#8221; she said at last,
trying to drag her hand away. She hated the dry feel
of Nurse&#8217;s black cotton gloves pinched around her cold
fingers. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t we going to buy any sweets after all?&#8221;
she went on.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>&#8220;Do you hear?&#8221; shouted Peggy desperately, and pulling
harder.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should learn to do as you&#8217;re told,&#8221; said Nurse,
taking a firmer grip, and walking faster still.</p>

<p>Peggy pulled harder still. She was beginning to feel
really naughty. Besides, she knew it had been a Fairy,
and who could think of stupid old ditches then? Nurse
<i>never</i> understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>have</i> you got on your thumb?&#8221; asked Nurse,
suddenly stopping, and dropping Peggy&#8217;s hand very quickly.</p>

<p>Peggy looked down, and there was the Fairy Ring
sending out great sparkles of green light all over the muddy
road! She could scarcely believe her eyes, and Nurse looked
rather frightened.</p>

<p>Peggy felt there was not a second to lose.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Giant, I wish you&#8217;d take me away somewhere&mdash;and
make Nurse nicer!&#8221; she whispered in a great hurry.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> a oner, you are!&#8221; said the Giant admiringly.
&#8220;You nearly always ask for two things in one wish&mdash;but it
never seems to matter&mdash;you get &#8217;em! Now come along,
we&#8217;ve got to hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy and the Giant were walking along a wide silver
road. The hedges, the gates, the trees, the flowers, even the
birds that flew over their heads, were silver, all sparkling
and gleaming in the light of a big silver moon in a blue sky.
Peggy had never seen anything so beautiful, and she looked
up at the Giant with very happy eyes as she danced along
the road by his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall always leave you to think of lovely places,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I should never have thought of coming here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Ring as well,&#8221; said the Giant modestly. &#8220;But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
we aren&#8217;t there yet. Sit on my hand; we shall get there
quicker that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, where are we going?&#8221; asked Peggy, jumping
up and holding on to his thumb.</p>

<p>&#8220;To Fairy-land,&#8221; said the Giant, stepping out briskly,
&#8220;or at least to one little bit of it. It&#8217;s only as a great treat,
because you couldn&#8217;t find a primrose, and never got your
sweets. By the way, that <i>was</i> a Fairy in the hedge,&#8221; he
added.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>knew</i> it was,&#8221; said Peggy. &#8220;But Nannie <i>won&#8217;t</i> see
things sometimes. Oh, look! what <i>is</i> this coming?&#8221;</p>

<p>They had turned a corner, and saw far away above the
hills something that appeared to be a great blue cloud edged
with gold, advancing with a humming sound. As it came
nearer Peggy discovered to her great excitement that it was
really a multitude of Fairies all dressed in the palest blue
dresses, their golden hair flowing out around them, and on
their heads silver crowns studded with bright blue stones;
and the humming sound was the rustle of their great blue
wings which were bearing them along at a tremendous rate.</p>

<p>They made straight for Peggy, led by a tall, beautiful
Fairy, whose blue dress was simply covered with sparkling
stones. And there was something in her pretty smiling
face which reminded Peggy of someone, but she couldn&#8217;t
remember who. The next moment the Fairy was just above
the Giant&#8217;s head; then she dropped suddenly, and catching
Peggy up by the hand she and all the rest of the Fairies
rose high in the air again and flew off by the way they had
come.</p>

<p>Peggy clutched the Fairy&#8217;s hand very tightly for some
time, for they were all going so fast that the rush of air
made her feel quite breathless. But when she was rather
more used to it, she turned her head to look at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Fairies following, and suddenly saw that she had grown a
magnificent pair of blue wings too!</p>

<p>She at once tried to flap them, and found she could do
so quite well, though rather jerkily at first, and the Giant&mdash;who
was striding along in the air just below her&mdash;looked
up with a wide grin on his round face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Capital, capital!&#8221; he called out. &#8220;Well, how do you
like flying?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s <i>lovely</i>!&#8221; shouted back Peggy. &#8220;You <i>do</i> think of
splendid things! And so do you!&#8221; she added, looking up
gratefully into the Fairy&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>And then she gave a great start, for, of course, she saw
now who the Fairy was. She was Nurse!</p>

<p>Peggy gasped, and very nearly dropped right down. It
was certainly Nurse, but Nurse looking happy, Nurse looking
pleased with Peggy, Nurse seeming as though for once she
was actually enjoying herself! It really seemed too good
to be true, and Peggy darted another glance of great
thankfulness down at the Giant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you think it fun,&#8221; said Nurse, in a sweet, clear
voice. &#8220;But you needn&#8217;t flap quite so hard. Look, give
long, steady sweeps like this,&#8221; and she sprang forward even
quicker into the air, and then showed Peggy exactly how it
was done, till she had learnt perfectly.</p>

<p>The land was changing below them, or they were much
higher up. It was sometimes bright and coloured like a
rainbow, sometimes as red as fire, and sometimes so dark
that they could see nothing below them. Once a terrible
smell of smoke rose up, and Nurse called to everyone to
mount higher.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a dreadful place that was,&#8221; said Peggy, when
they once more saw the pretty rainbow land below them
again. &#8220;Who lives there?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>&#8220;Ogres,&#8221; said Nurse, &#8220;heaps of them. I hate passing
their way, but it&#8217;s a short cut. That red country we passed
just now was where the Dragons live. They&#8217;re even worse,
nasty ill-bred creatures! However, we&#8217;ve passed them all
now, and here we come down.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were right above a cleared space in a big black
wood, and at a signal from Nurse, all the Fairies paused,
and, half folding their wings, floated down amongst the
trees. Peggy did so too, and balanced on a large branch,
closing her wings up neatly as she saw the others doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, each take a tree and begin,&#8221; called Nurse, who
was flying about looking happier than ever, &#8220;and after that
we&#8217;ll have some games!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Peggy noticed what extraordinary trees they were
all perched upon. For from every twig were hanging by
silver strings the most fascinating little tiny sugar animals
and birds of every colour and kind&mdash;blue elephants, mauve
dogs, scarlet mice, yellow nightingales, and everything else
you can think of. And all through the wood she could
hear the Fairies calling and laughing to each other as they
fluttered up and down the trees and ate the pretty things.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I?&#8221; asked Peggy, her fingers closing round a
purple sparrow, and looking at Nurse who she hardly dared
believe would be so changed as to allow her to eat as many
sweets as she liked!</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Nurse smiling&mdash;and Peggy had never
realised before how very nicely Nurse could smile. She also
longed to tell her how pretty she looked with her golden hair
all flying loose in the air. But she didn&#8217;t dare. &#8220;I advise
you to try that pink cow just behind you,&#8221; went on Nurse.
&#8220;No, not that one, the very big one by the trunk. That&#8217;s it.
Now, <i>isn&#8217;t</i> that good?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was certainly too lovely for words. It had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
delicious taste that a strawberry ice has before you&#8217;ve eaten
too many at a party, and it was also rather like pineapples
and pear-drops and Tangerine oranges, and yet it was far
better than any of them.</p>

<p>Peggy soon got quite good at half fluttering, half
balancing along the branches like the others were doing,
and trying each different sweet by turn.</p>

<p>(I&#8217;m afraid this sounds rather a greedy adventure of
Peggy&#8217;s, but it wasn&#8217;t really, as it happened in Fairy-land,
and there were enough sweets for everyone, and no one
felt sick when they&#8217;d eaten too many.)</p>

<p>She had just bitten a pink sugar rabbit in half, and
found it tasted just like meringues, when she remembered
the Giant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;where is the Giant? I&#8217;d quite
forgotten him!&#8221;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>FE-FO-FUM!</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Nurse</span> looked very worried indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;So had I,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We must have gone too fast for
him!&#8221; And she flew up on to the top of a tree and gazed
away across the hills. &#8220;He never <i>will</i> let us lend him
wings,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;so he always gets left behind. He
says his seven-leagued boots will last <i>him</i> out all right,
and it&#8217;s no good arguing with him. Now, I expect he&#8217;s
stuck somewhere, or has stumbled upon the Ogres and
had a fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried Peggy in great horror. &#8220;My Giant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
fighting? Oh, he&#8217;d <i>sure</i> to be beaten. What shall I do?&#8221;
and she fluttered to and fro in great distress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, wish he were here, of course,&#8221; said Nurse.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve five wishes left still, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy wished at once, and the Giant came crashing
through the wood, upsetting the sugar trees in all directions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, look!&#8221; said Nurse. &#8220;<i>How</i> careless you are!&#8221;
(But she didn&#8217;t say it a bit in her old cross way.) &#8220;Plant
those trees again before you do anything else!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Giant looked terribly knocked about and woebegone,
and his coat was all in tatters, but he did as he
was told at once, balancing the trees up again, and stamping
in their roots well, like Peggy had seen the gardener do with
his plants. Then he sat down on the ground and wiped his
hot face with his pocket-handkerchief, and the Fairies all
stopped eating sweets to hear what he had to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phew!&#8221; he gasped, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had an awful time! Whatever
possessed you all to go at such a pace?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I like that!&#8221; said Nurse. &#8220;When it was you
who asked us to get to the sugar-wood before dark!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I hadn&#8217;t now,&#8221; said the Giant. &#8220;Trying to catch
you up I stumbled right into the middle of the Ogres, and
I&#8217;d no sooner got away from them&mdash;after having my coat
torn half off my back&mdash;than I stepped plump on to the Red
Dragon, and you know what <i>that</i> means!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, dear!&#8221; said Nurse. &#8220;Was he very vexed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Vexed!&#8221; said the Giant. &#8220;He was in such a hideous
passion that he made after me as fast as he could waddle&mdash;and
then he started gliding. I was up in the air in a
moment, I can tell you, striding along for all I was worth,
and when he saw he couldn&#8217;t catch me from the ground
he took to his wings and flew! And when a Dragon uses
his wings&mdash;well&mdash;you know what you&#8217;ve got to expect!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
He&#8217;s after me now&mdash;and the Ogres are, too!&#8221; he added
resignedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;ll never find you here!&#8221; said Nurse. &#8220;The
Ring brought you along faster than any Ogre or Dragon
could travel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought an Ogre was almost the same as a Giant?&#8221;
Peggy whispered to Nurse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious, no!&#8221; said she. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let the Giant
hear you say that! They&#8217;re a set of vagabonds and ruffians
who haunt the edge of Fairy-land. The kind with one eye
in their foreheads, and the sort who say &#8216;Fe-Fo-Fum.&#8217;
You <i>must</i> have read about them? They can&#8217;t harm us
Fairies, but any Giant, especially a really nice good one
like yours, makes them simply <i>mad</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy slid off her branch and flew to the Giant, perching
on his shoulder and stroking his hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take care of you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if they <i>do</i> come. Don&#8217;t
you be afraid! He&#8217;ll be all right, won&#8217;t he?&#8221; she added,
turning to the Fairies.</p>

<p>But they were not listening.</p>

<p>They had all flown to the tops of their trees and were
balancing on the topmost branches, bending forward and
listening intently. For there was a soft humming,
grumbling, hissing, bleating, gurgling sound coming from
somewhere very far away!</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the Ogres,&#8221; said Nurse, looking very grave&mdash;and
the sound got a tiny bit louder.</p>

<p>Then a little cold, tinkling, rippling, singing, shivering,
clinking sound began as well&mdash;so faint that it was just like
a funny little whisper, and &#8220;That&#8217;s the Dragon and he&#8217;ll
be here first!&#8221; cried all the Fairies together, looking
graver still, and they began to flutter round Peggy and
the Giant, staring at the Ring, which was winking and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
flashing long green darts of light over everything and
everybody.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I wish?&#8221; asked Peggy, glancing at the
Giant, who was obviously too tired out to move another step.
(The sounds were every second getting louder and louder.)
&#8220;I&mdash;I should rather like to see them,&#8221; she added shyly,
&#8220;if I can make the dear Giant <i>quite</i> safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wish me to be invisible,&#8221; said the Giant wearily.
&#8220;Then I shan&#8217;t have to get up. I&#8217;ve been practising it,
so you won&#8217;t have any difficulty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;ll do nicely,&#8221; said Nurse. The noise had
suddenly become so loud that Peggy could hardly hear her.
&#8220;And you get as much behind the trunk as you can,&#8221; she
went on to Peggy at the top of her voice, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll sit on a
branch in front of you and hide you. If they <i>do</i> see you,
you&#8217;ve only got to wish yourself invisible too.&#8221;</p>

<p>The noise had now changed to the rattling kind that a
million luggage trains would make if they were all driven
along in a row at once, and Peggy could hear tree after tree
crashing to the ground. She had only just time to wish, and
see the Giant disappear completely, when a great red
creature plunged down through the branches above into the
open space in front of the Fairies, and fell on his side, quite
close to Peggy&#8217;s tree, lashing his tail and panting like a dog.</p>

<p>Tongues of red and blue fire flashed and darted up and
down his scaly back, and his scarlet wings spreading across
the grass withered it up at once. Peggy did feel glad she
hadn&#8217;t missed the sight! But she took the precaution
to wish that he should not crush the Giant, in case invisible
Giants <i>could</i> be crushed.</p>

<p>In a few seconds the Dragon rolled on to his little short
stubbly feet and waddled up to Nurse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the Giant?&#8221; he lisped in a high and very soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
voice. &#8220;I <i>know</i> he&#8217;s somewhere here, and I&#8217;ll flatten down
every one of your sugar trees if you don&#8217;t tell me this
minute!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus036.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">Peggy drew this to show what the Dragon looked like when Nurse
said, &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t dare!&#8221; Nurse is on the left and is just going
to eat her sugar bird. Peggy is up above peeping from behind
the tree. She wanted to draw the Ogres too, but there wasn&#8217;t any
room. Mother only helped her with some of the branches, everything
else she did by herself, and the Fairies took ages to do.
They are sitting on the boughs eating the sugar animals and
birds. It made the Dragon <span class="u">furious</span> to see they weren&#8217;t afraid of
him a bit. Those long things on the ground are the trees he
knocked down, and the bits of red are the fires he started
with his red-hot paws. The Giant is invisible sitting on the
grass, just behind the Dragon&#8217;s tongue.</p>

<p>There was really something very frightening in his little
polite voice!</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t dare!&#8221; said Nurse, laughing scornfully.
&#8220;Run along and look about for him! He must be somewhere,
as you rightly remark,&#8221; and she turned her back on him and
began to nibble at a sugar bird.</p>

<p>The Dragon raised his eyebrows ironically, but finding
Nurse was not looking at him any longer, he began to
trot and glide about the wood, sticking his long red tongue
under the fallen trees to lift them up, and hissing to
himself more and more when he couldn&#8217;t find the Giant
anywhere.</p>

<p>(And all the time the sound of the Ogres coming got
louder and louder and louder!)</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some magic going on!&#8221; said the Dragon at last,
angrily, raising himself up on to the very tip of his tail and
glaring over the tree-tops. &#8220;Ha, ha!&#8221; he added, &#8220;here
come the others at last,&#8221; and he stretched out two welcoming
paws to the two enormous Ogres who at that moment
crashed into the wood.</p>

<p>Peggy nearly tumbled out of the tree in her excitement,
for this was worth seeing indeed! One of the Ogres had
only one eye in the middle of his forehead, just as she&#8217;d
thought he would, and he did nothing but say &#8220;Fe-Fo-Fum!&#8221;
over and over again, and stamp and growl and snarl.</p>

<p>The other one had three heads which all looked different
ways, and he kept gnashing his three lots of teeth and snorting
at the Dragon, who <i>would</i> go on smiling at him.</p>

<p>Then both Ogres advanced upon Nurse, brandishing
their clubs.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>&#8220;We went miles out of our way!&#8221; they roared.
&#8220;Where&#8217;s he gone to now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nurse looked them over calmly from head to toe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take your caps off this moment,&#8221; she said severely.
&#8220;I <i>think</i> you forget who you&#8217;re speaking to!&#8221;</p>

<p>They looked rather cowed for the moment, and took
their caps off sheepishly without saying a word, though the
Dragon&#8217;s chuckle was enough to infuriate anybody. (The
Ogre with the three heads had of course to take off three
caps.)</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better!&#8221; said Nurse. &#8220;Now, what <i>do</i> you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Giant, of course,&#8221; growled the Ogre with one eye.
&#8220;Fe-Fo-Fum! Fe-Fo-Fum!&#8221; and he trampled up and
down restlessly.</p>

<p>It was more than Peggy could stand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>do</i> go on with the verse!&#8221; she called out imploringly,
leaning forward right out of the tree. &#8220;You&#8217;ve said that line
over and over again, and it&#8217;s not <i>nearly</i> all! You <i>must</i>
remember how it goes on:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8216;Fe-Fo-Fum!</div>
<div class="verse">I smell the blood of an Englishman!</div>
<div class="verse">Be he alive&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>but she got no further, for with a scream of triumph the
Dragon flung himself forward and seized her tree right up by
the roots, and the nearest Ogre at the same moment plucked
her out of it by his finger and thumb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, Miss Peggy!&#8221; screamed Nurse, and Peggy did
wish quick, ... and found herself back on the old
muddy high road again, being dragged along it by Nurse.
&#8220;For if you don&#8217;t hurry a bit more,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;you&#8217;ll
catch your death of cold in those wet socks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy burst into tears. Nurse was no longer a bit like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
a nice Fairy, and it was all such a dreadfully sudden change,
and everything felt so very flat. Even the stone in her
Ring looked small, and as dull as a pebble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear, oh dear!&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;And we never got to
the games at all! And I&#8217;ve still got one wish left that I
never used. Now it will be wasted!&#8221; and the tears poured
fast down her cheeks.</p>

<p>Nurse looked down at her in astonishment, for Peggy
never cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s come over you all of a sudden?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>wish</i> you were always nice like just now,&#8221; sobbed
Peggy, quite forgetting Nurse never remembered anything
about the adventures. &#8220;We were having such a <i>lovely</i> time!
And then you went and made me leave at the most exciting
bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s very exciting to stand in a muddy
ditch!&#8221; said Nurse, but her voice had all at once become
very soft and gentle. &#8220;But never mind, Miss Peggy dear.
I&#8217;ll tell you the story of the Three Bears now if you like,
then we shall soon get home. And perhaps there&#8217;ll be a
letter from Mother; I shouldn&#8217;t wonder!&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy could scarcely believe her ears, for except in
Fairy-land Nurse never really talked like that. Her tears
were forgotten very quickly, for Nurse went on being like it
all the rest of the day, laughing and playing and romping
with Peggy right up till bedtime, and even a little while
after!</p>

<p>Peggy <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> make it out.</p>

<p>You see she never noticed that she <i>had</i> used up her
sixth wish after all.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>PEGGY DRIVES A CAR</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;What&#8217;s</span> that whizzing, Nurse?&#8221; asked Peggy, as she
was picking a bunch of double snowdrops in the garden
the next afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;A motor, I expect,&#8221; said Nurse, who was talking to the
gardener&mdash;and she ran to peep down the drive through the
bushes. &#8220;Callers, I&#8217;ll be bound. Yes, here it comes, a big
red car. There&#8217;s a fat lady in behind, and a girl chauffeur
driving it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see,&#8221; said Peggy, pressing into the bushes too.</p>

<p>Nurse was not quite like she had been the evening
before, because, of course, Peggy&#8217;s wishes never lasted on to
the next day, but still she wasn&#8217;t <i>nearly</i> as cross as usual, and
she had been playing hide-and-seek with Peggy quite half
the afternoon, until the gardener came up to talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now they&#8217;ve heard your Mother&#8217;s not here, and are
going away again,&#8221; Nurse went on. &#8220;There, look! They&#8217;ve
stuck at the difficult turn, and the engine&#8217;s stopped! My,
doesn&#8217;t that girl look cross? Get back, Miss Peggy, they&#8217;ll
see us! Now you can hide once more if you like before tea.
I&#8217;ll just finish giving John the message about the
vegetables.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I knew how to drive a motor,&#8221; thought Peggy
longingly, as she trotted off to hide behind some laurels.
&#8220;I&#8217;d go like the wind, and wouldn&#8217;t stop at any corners&mdash;&mdash;Why&mdash;what&#8217;s
happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>For she was driving the big red car as fast as lightning
down the drive!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>&#8220;You never noticed you had the Ring on!&#8221; chuckled
the Giant. &#8220;Well turned! Never mind the gate-post.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was sitting at the back, but with his legs sticking right
out in front beyond the bonnet; and his elbows kept knocking
great pieces out of the hedges as they whizzed along.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s&mdash;what&#8217;s happened to the fat lady and the
chauffeur?&#8221; gasped Peggy, clutching the steering-wheel for
dear life, her cheeks scarlet, her hair streaming out
behind her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I put them out in the drive,&#8221; said the Giant. &#8220;I
expect they&#8217;ll follow us if they want to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Weren&#8217;t they angry?&#8221; asked Peggy, bumping over a
sheep because she didn&#8217;t know how to stop the car. &#8220;Oh
dear, did I hurt him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all right, he&#8217;s up again,&#8221; said the Giant, turning
round. &#8220;The Ring won&#8217;t let you hurt anything or anybody
however much you knock into them. Angry? Oh, I really
hadn&#8217;t time to stop and see. It&#8217;s all forgotten afterwards,
you see. Look out for this corner. Oh well, never mind, we
may as well be out of the road as in it!&#8221; For the car, not
having been turned quick enough, had neatly leapt the
hedge, and was now speeding across a ploughed field.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her out, let her out!&#8221; said the Giant. &#8220;You said
you wanted to go fast, I thought. Go on, let her out!&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy didn&#8217;t know exactly what he meant, or what to
do, but she whispered a wish that they might go still quicker,
and the car rose in the air and raced along just a little above
the level of the hedges.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think this is lovelier than anything we&#8217;ve done at
all!&#8221; she shouted back to the Giant. &#8220;Oh, look! we&#8217;re
coming to a town, I do believe! I wish I could drive
through it just as though I was a real chauffeur. It would
be so <i>grand</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>&#8220;Steady, steady! Wishes don&#8217;t grow on blackberry
bushes,&#8221; cried the Giant warningly, but at once the car
slowed down, and dropped into the high road, and Peggy
found herself dressed exactly like the girl she had seen,
and driving slowly along at the rate of about fifteen miles
an hour. At first she tried to steer the car herself, but when
she found that it guided itself when left alone, and that the
horn sounded and the gear changed much better by themselves,
she leant back and amused herself by staring at the
people, and then at the shops, as they reached the principal
streets of the town.</p>

<p>Suddenly she noticed that all the people they passed
were beginning to behave in the most extraordinary manner,
some of them racing away down side streets, screaming,
others beginning to chase the car and shout at the top of
their voices. Once they came on a line of policemen all
standing in a row across the road with notebooks in their
hands, but the car made very short work of them, scattering
them in all directions, and though Peggy turned round and
saw them picking themselves up at once and evidently not
hurt in the very least, such a roar went up from the crowds
in the streets that she asked the Giant in great perplexity
why they were all so angry. Hadn&#8217;t they ever seen a lady
chauffeur before?</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect it&#8217;s partly because of me,&#8221; said the Giant
comfortably. &#8220;I knocked a piece right off the General
Post Office just now with my elbow. You&#8217;d better rise
again, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy wished&mdash;but to her horror nothing happened,
except that the car began to slow down, and crowds and
crowds of people from all directions at once pressed around
it, shouting and shaking their fists at the Giant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness me!&#8221; said the Giant, who had no sooner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
pushed away one lot than another came up. &#8220;The Magic&#8217;s
gone wrong again! Turn the Ring quickly!&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy did so, and the car rose with an awful jerk into
the air and began to twist in and out amongst the chimney
pots in an aimless sort of way till the Giant nearly toppled
out, and Peggy felt quite giddy. At last she seized the
wheel and tried to steer, and really felt they were making
a little headway, when suddenly, without any warning, the
car made a dart upwards, and then dropped on to the top
of an ornamental steeple crowning the new Town Hall,
where it stuck, the wheels turning madly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we <i>are</i> in a fix!&#8221; said the Giant uneasily. &#8220;I
thought I&#8217;d remembered all about the wishing by now,
but I&#8217;ve made a hash of it this time, and no mistake.
You&#8217;d better wish we were safely home again. I can
always manage <i>that</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you!&#8221; said Peggy. &#8220;I did that yesterday
before I&#8217;d used up all my wishes. I&#8217;m not going to do it
again. I don&#8217;t mind it up here at all; I think it&#8217;s rather
fun!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>That&#8217;s</i> not much fun!&#8221; said the Giant, looking down
out of the car.</p>

<p>Peggy looked too&mdash;and could not help giving a little
jump. Packed in the Square below them was the first
crowd she had ever seen, and it was really rather
frightening. Everybody was looking up and shouting and
waving, and there was no doubt at all that they were
very angry indeed. Still, in spite of the muddles the
Giant so often made, Peggy always felt perfectly safe
with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>can&#8217;t</i> hear what they say,&#8221; she said, &#8220;all talking at
once like that! Do call down and ask them to speak clearer.
They&#8217;ll hear <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>But the Giant was shaking with fright, and trying to
hide himself under the seat, which, considering he was many
sizes too big for the car, looked a hopeless task.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better leave them alone,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;They&#8217;ll only
get angrier still if we answer them.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment Peggy noticed a little fat man in a long
red gown making his way through the crowd. Behind him
came two men carrying a long ladder. This they put
against the Town Hall, and the little fat man climbed to the
top, and then off on to the roof just below the car. He was
purple in the face with breathlessness and rage.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>THE MAYOR&#8217;S OUTING</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;That&#8217;s</span> the Mayor, that is,&#8221; said the Giant in a terrified
whisper, and he practically stood on his head in his efforts
to wriggle part of his face under the seat. &#8220;If there is one
thing that frightens me more than another it is a Mayor!
I remember in 1615, or thereabouts&mdash;but that will keep till
another time. Do you think he can see me? Can&#8217;t we go
on <i>now</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not!&#8221; said Peggy. &#8220;I want to hear what
he&#8217;s going to say. He can&#8217;t <i>do</i> anything to us, you know.
Really, I think this is the best adventure of all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi!&#8221; called the Mayor. &#8220;Go on this moment, or we&#8217;ll
make you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t!&#8221; shouted Peggy. &#8220;We&#8217;re stuck! A bit of
the spire&#8217;s come right through the car!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; shouted the Mayor, &#8220;you can get off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
perfectly well if you choose. The spire wasn&#8217;t built for the
likes of you to go trapesing about on. Get off it!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus046.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">This is a painting of the Fourth Adventure. Peggy is just telling
the Mayor that they&#8217;ve stuck. She&#8217;s rather afraid the Giant will
fall out in a minute, that&#8217;s why she&#8217;s holding on to his back. You
can see by her face she isn&#8217;t a bit frightened of the Mayor. This
was Mother&#8217;s favourite picture. The Mayor was very difficult
to draw, but he looked <span class="u">just</span> like that Peggy said. None of the
crowd had on red jackets really, but Peggy thought they looked
pretty in a picture. You see the Ring, don&#8217;t you? Peggy quite
forgot about the Giant&#8217;s red stockings till the picture was finished!</p>

<p>&#8220;We <i>cant</i>, I tell you!&#8221; cried Peggy, losing all patience.
&#8220;Come up and look for yourself! Come on, climb on to the
Giant&#8217;s boot!&#8221; For by this time the Giant had given up
trying to hide himself, and was sitting on the car with his
legs dangling into space, and looking the picture of misery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stretch your foot down a little more,&#8221; said Peggy to
him. &#8220;There,&#8221; as it dangled just above the Mayor&#8217;s head,
&#8220;now jump this instant!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t!&#8221; said the Mayor, ducking his head as the
great boot hovered above it. &#8220;I never heard of such
proceedings in my life!&#8221; He leant over the edge of the
roof. &#8220;They <i>won&#8217;t</i> go on!&#8221; he shouted to the crowd below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make &#8217;em!&#8221; came in a perfect roar from the Square.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along,&#8221; said Peggy coaxingly. (It would be
something, she felt, to tell Nurse when she got back that she
had had a real live Mayor in her car. Besides, it would be fun
for him. But she wasn&#8217;t going to use up a wish on it.
Peggy had grown very wary by this time.)</p>

<p>The Mayor stood looking very undecided, but when he
saw the crowd beginning to shake their fists at him as well,
he gave a jump, caught the Giant&#8217;s boot, and raised himself
into a sitting position on the toe of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you promise to do your best to get off if I come
up and have a look?&#8221; he asked in a shaking voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we will,&#8221; said Peggy soothingly.&mdash;&#8220;Don&#8217;t
look such a big frightened baby!&#8221; she added reprovingly to
the Giant.&mdash;&#8220;Draw your boot up gently. There, that&#8217;s
right&#8221;&mdash;as the Mayor was sidled carefully off into the front
seat; &#8220;<i>now</i> I wish we could go on!&#8221;</p>





<p>The car shook itself all over, then leapt upwards, and
once more set off at breakneck speed, but this time straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
upwards into the sky! Something at the same moment fell
out with a heavy flop. Peggy turned her head hastily, just
in time to see the Giant falling through the air behind them.
But the car was rising upwards at such a pace that the next
moment he and the whole town disappeared from view!</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Stop!</i>&#8221; said a frightened voice at her side, and she
turned and saw the Mayor, whom for the moment she had
<i>quite</i> forgotten. His face was no longer purple, but as white
as a sheet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t!&#8221; said Peggy. &#8220;I&#8217;ve only one wish left, and
that&#8217;s got to take me home. You asked me to get off the
spire, you know, and I <i>have</i>! The Giant&#8217;s wearing his seven-leagued
boots, so he&#8217;ll soon catch us up when he gets balanced
again.&#8221; She skirted the edge of a pink sunset cloud as she
spoke, and drove right up through a lemon-coloured one.
&#8220;Oh, how lovely!&#8221; she went on delightedly. &#8220;I got a great
chunk of it in my mouth, and it tasted just like pineapple.
Did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about,&#8221; said the
Mayor. &#8220;We&#8217;ve just been through an awful fog, and I insist
on you stopping the car at once. If you can&#8217;t&mdash;and I see you
don&#8217;t understand the first rudiments of driving&mdash;I can!&#8221;</p>

<p>He leant across her and seized the steering-wheel, but
it at once came off in his hand, rolled down his arm, and
jumped out of the car.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>There!</i>&#8221; said Peggy triumphantly, to the now speechless
Mayor. &#8220;See what comes of meddling!&#8221; (She felt
quite like Nurse when she spoke like that.) &#8220;Never mind,
my car goes just as well without <i>that</i> bit!&#8221; and she leant
back in her seat and crossed her arms grandly. &#8220;The only
thing I&#8217;m worrying about,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;is, if the Giant
will ever find us! You don&#8217;t see him coming, do you?
Look down through the hole in the car.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>&#8220;Unless you stop, I shall jump out,&#8221; said the Mayor in
a desperate voice. And he stood up and really looked as
though he meant to!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>do</i> sit down,&#8221; said Peggy. &#8220;You spoil everything.
Just look, we&#8217;re going right on to this rainbow, I do believe!
Yes, we&#8217;re on the purple part. Isn&#8217;t it a lovely smooth road?
There, now, we&#8217;re off it and on the pink bit! Oh, why <i>don&#8217;t</i>
you sit still and love it all as I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m going to get out,&#8221; said the Mayor, stepping
over the door and lowering himself slowly till only his hand
holding the step, and his very reproachful face showed themselves.
&#8220;Now then,&#8221; he added, &#8220;you&#8217;ve only got till I count
five; I shall let go then&mdash;perhaps&#8221;&mdash;he added in a whisper,
being a truthful Mayor, but very softly so that she shouldn&#8217;t
hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear, it <i>is</i> mean of you to make me use up my last
wish so soon!&#8221; said Peggy in a very vexed voice. &#8220;And I
managed this drive especially for you, to make up for our
having spoilt the Post Office and things.&mdash;Oh, very well,&#8221;
she added crossly, as the Mayor reached four, and let go
one hand, &#8220;I wish you were home and I was too, because
you simply spoil everything when you won&#8217;t play
properly!&#8221;...</p>

<p>&#8220;If I do, it&#8217;s not for you to say so, Miss Peggy,&#8221; was
the reply, and Peggy found herself back in the garden
again facing a rather red-faced and angry Nurse. &#8220;Just
because I stop to speak to John for one moment, is no
reason for you to think yourself neglected! I&#8217;m sure I
never heard you call you were ready, so how was I to
know? Then you come bouncing down on me like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Nannie, did I bounce?&#8221; asked Peggy, very much
interested. She had wondered before what her return looked
like when the wishes were over.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t repeat my words,&#8221; said Nurse crossly. &#8220;I was
meaning the way you spoke, of course. How could you
bounce down from behind the laurels? Now, come along
into tea at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Nannie, I&#8217;ve had such fun!&#8221; said Peggy, dancing
along the path. &#8220;I went <i>up</i>, and <i>up</i>, and <i>up</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; exclaimed Nurse. &#8220;One moment it&#8217;s grumble,
grumble, the next all the other way! I won&#8217;t have you
climbing trees either in hide-and-seek. You can&#8217;t expect
to be found if you act like that. Now&mdash;not another
word&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid the Giant&#8217;s dreadfully lost this time!&#8221;
thought Peggy, as she washed her hands for tea. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
fink I was very kind to him! I do wonder if the fat lady
minded the big hole in the car, and the wheel being lost.
Oh, but I suppose that all comes right again, just as she
forgets that the Giant sat her down in the drive! It would
be lovely to tell Nannie that I&#8217;d driven a Mayor up a rainbow
in a real motor car! But it&#8217;s no good <i>trying</i> to, she
doesn&#8217;t understand the sensiblest things.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she ran into the day nursery to see which jam cook
had sent up for tea.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>DOWN!</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;See</span> me dance the polka!&#8221; went the old tune&mdash;and then
again and again&mdash;and Peggy lay in bed listening to it and
staring at the fire.</p>

<p>The children next door were having a party in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
hall, and every time the front door opened the sound of the
music came crashing out, and jumped in through Peggy&#8217;s
open window. Of course, she ought to have been at the
party too, but, for one thing, she had had a cold all day,
and for another, Nurse didn&#8217;t think the children next door
had properly got over measles, so she was afraid to let
Peggy go.</p>

<p>Peggy hadn&#8217;t much minded until now. Nurse had
petted her all day and given her little bits of buttered
toast at tea with apricot jam on them, and then had let
the housemaid come up and play dominoes with her until
bedtime, and now she had tucked her up warmly in bed
with a hot-water bottle and told her to go to sleep quickly,
so that she should be quite well before Mother came home
the next day.</p>

<p>But go to sleep was just what Peggy couldn&#8217;t do. For
one thing, thinking of Mother coming back was enough to
make her keep wanting to jump out of bed and dance all
over the room. And then the music too had begun to
make her rather long to run into the house next door and
play musical chairs with all the other children.</p>

<p>It was then that she suddenly felt the Ring pressing on
her thumb, and realised that she had quite forgotten to
wish at all that day!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear, suppose it hadn&#8217;t come, I might have
forgotten altogether,&#8221; she thought in dismay. &#8220;And
now I&#8217;m rather frightened of seeing the Giant, in case
he&#8217;s angry about the Mayor. I wonder what I&#8217;d better
wish?&#8221;</p>

<p>She lay in bed thinking about it for quite a long time,
until suddenly hearing some carriages driving off and the
music stopping, she realised she was too late to wish to join
the children&#8217;s party next door anyway.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, I wish the Giant was here,&#8221; she said at last.
&#8220;He can always think of lovely things to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your window&#8217;s uncommonly small,&#8221; said the Giant,
climbing in through it, and bringing with him big bits of the
wall on each shoulder. &#8220;Gracious me, what a mess I&#8217;m in!&#8221;
He shook himself and lay down on the floor with his face
close to the fire. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been looking in at the party next
door,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;Great fun&mdash;but they&#8217;re gone now. I
saw &#8217;em into their cabs. Why weren&#8217;t you there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;ve a cold,&#8221; said Peggy, sneezing three times.
(The Giant seemed to have brought in all the cold night air
with him.) &#8220;Nannie thinks I caught it hiding behind the
laurels so long yesterday, but <i>I</i> know it was going through
that lovely wet yellow cloud!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Giant&#8217;s face clouded over. &#8220;Least said soonest
mended about that,&#8221; he said shortly. &#8220;I particularly told
you of my aversion to Mayors, and you at once take one for
a drive and leave me behind! That was not in the least
what I meant. However, I will say no more. This is
your last day but one with me, so we won&#8217;t waste it
with quarrelling. What&#8217;s your wish? Be quick now, for
this lovely hot fire makes me very sleepy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy jumped out of bed, caught hold of the Giant&#8217;s
little finger and hugged it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <i>so</i> sorry,&#8221; she said coaxingly. &#8220;I like you better
than any Mayor that ever was born, Giant darling. And I
didn&#8217;t <i>mean</i> to leave you behind. Did you have an awful
time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I went wandering about the sky for the rest of
the night looking for you,&#8221; said the Giant. &#8220;I heard you&#8217;d
been on the rainbow, but after that I lost all trace of you.
Still, never mind; as you&#8217;re sorry, I don&#8217;t mind any more.
Go on, wish away.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>&#8220;It&#8217;s no good, I&#8217;ve tried to,&#8221; said Peggy. &#8220;We seem to
have done everything exciting. We&#8217;ve been up&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about going down for a change?&#8221; asked the
Giant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down?&#8221; said Peggy. &#8220;But we <i>are</i> down!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus054.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">This is a picture of the fifth Adventure. The mark on the ceiling is
the awful hole the Giant and Peggy made coming through. The
Giant is waving his hand to Cook as they go down. The footman
has only just seen the hole, and is showing it to everybody.
The housemaid who played dominoes with Peggy is screaming
out &#8220;Stop them, Cook!&#8221; and the scullery maid has sat down on the
floor with her hands over her face. Cook is fainting by the table.
She had just put a pudding on it for the servants supper. Peggy
couldn&#8217;t put Nurse into the picture because she wasn&#8217;t sure if she
was in the kitchen then or not. You <span class="u">do</span> see the Ring, don&#8217;t you?</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you call <i>this</i> down?&#8221; said the Giant laughing.
&#8220;Come along, get on my hand and wish,&#8221; and he laid his
hand palm upwards on the hearthrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wish what?&#8221; asked Peggy, putting on her blue
dressing-gown and slippers.</p>

<p>&#8220;To go down, of course,&#8221; said the Giant impatiently.
&#8220;Has your cold made you deaf?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, all right, I wish to go down,&#8221; said Peggy, clambering
up on to the Giant&#8217;s hand. &#8220;But it sounds very dull&mdash;<i>Gracious!</i>
Hold me tight!&#8221; for they both at once went
right through the nursery floor and into the dining-room
below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, look!&#8221; said Peggy. &#8220;What a mess we&#8217;ve made
of the ceiling. The table&#8217;s all covered with bits of it!
Oughtn&#8217;t we to clear it up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t waste time,&#8221; said the Giant. &#8220;Come on,&#8221; and
down through the carpet they went and right into the
kitchen.</p>

<p>The servants were all at supper, but Peggy had only
just time to catch sight of their terrified faces and to hear
their chairs crashing to the floor as they all jumped up,
before the Giant went right through that floor too!</p>

<p>After that they went down so fast that her curls flew
up in a waving cone above her head, and the Giant&#8217;s beard
flapped across her face and hid everything. She shut her
eyes at last, until&mdash;&#8220;Open them, we&#8217;re down!&#8221; said the Giant,
and they both flopped on to some long brown grass.</p>



<p>Peggy stared round in astonishment. They were sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
in the middle of a great brown plain, edged all ground with
little pointed brown hills rising up to a golden sky. And,
&#8220;Oh, what ducky little houses!&#8221; cried Peggy, for nestling
up the sides of every hill were hundreds of tiny brown
thatched cottages, each with a dear little garden in front
of it, full of vegetables and brightly coloured berries.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where on earth are we?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nowhere,&#8221; said the Giant. &#8220;We&#8217;re <i>in</i> it. This is the
Pixies&#8217; country. Look, they&#8217;re coming out of their houses.
Do you see them? They&#8217;ve heard us coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>A great opening of doors sounded from all around, and
out poured the Pixies, and raced across the plain to Peggy
and the Giant. Little fat brown fellows they were, dressed
in dark shades of green and red, with round wrinkled faces
and pointed caps. When they were quite near, they all
stood in a crowd whispering and giggling, till two of them,
holding a huge curled-up yellow leaf between them, were
pushed forward towards Peggy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have they got?&#8221; she whispered to the Giant.</p>

<p>&#8220;An invitation, I expect,&#8221; he whispered back, &#8220;for the
party to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What party?&#8221; asked Peggy, but &#8220;Hush, don&#8217;t,
whisper, they&#8217;ll think you&#8217;re making personal remarks,&#8221;
answered the Giant. &#8220;They&#8217;re very sensitive.&#8221; And
certainly the Pixies carrying the leaf came to a dead stop,
and, apparently overcome with shyness, dropped it on the
ground, and raced back to their companions, where they
stood sniggering and covering their faces with their hands,
and peeping through their fingers at Peggy.</p>

<p>&#8220;How funny they are!&#8221; said Peggy in amazement.
&#8220;Why <i>do</i> they do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said the Giant. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s because
they have so few holidays and see so few people. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
they&#8217;re a queer lot, and I don&#8217;t profess to understand them!
You&#8217;d better read your invitation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy picked the leaf up, and, unrolling it, read as
follows: &#8220;We invite Peggy and the Giant to a Ball in the
Distant Purple Caves in half an hour. Skating, Eating,
Flitting, Mazing, Wending and other Amusements.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear, <i>how</i> exciting! Can I go?&#8221; asked Peggy,
beginning to dance about all over the plain.</p>

<p>The Giant took the invitation and read it slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My goodness me, it <i>is</i> going to be a smart affair!&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Yes, I think we can manage it all right. Only
we shall have to dress up for it, I&#8217;m afraid. It wouldn&#8217;t do
to look dowdy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what do Flitting, Mazing, and Wending mean?&#8221;
asked Peggy, looking at the invitation again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Flitting is flying round one after the other at
the very top of the caves and copying everything the front
Pixie does,&#8221; said the Giant, &#8220;and the one who goes on
longest gets a prize. It&#8217;s tiring, but exciting; a sort of
Follow-my-Leader, only a better game. And Wending is
dancing up and down the Unexplored Passages and seeing
who can pick up most diamonds first. They only have it at
the very grandest parties. And Mazing is&mdash;now, what <i>is</i>
Mazing? I&#8217;ve quite forgotten! However, I shall probably
remember it in a minute or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you accept?&#8221; asked a tiny, shy voice at Peggy&#8217;s
elbow, and she looked down to see a Pixie standing by her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;d <i>love</i> to come, and it&#8217;s very kind of you to
ask us,&#8221; said Peggy very politely. &#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll excuse
my writing,&#8221; she added, having sometimes heard her mother
say this.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d <i>love</i> to come!&#8221; shouted the Pixie to the others,
and &#8220;They&#8217;d <i>love</i> to come!&#8221; shouted the rest, till the hills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
echoed with the sound, and then they all turned and raced
back to their cottages, stopping now and then to giggle and
snigger and look over their shoulders at Peggy and the
Giant, before the little doors slammed again behind them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very over-excited indeed,&#8221; remarked the Giant.
&#8220;Now they&#8217;ll take the rest of the time dressing up. And, by
the way, we ought to be getting ready too.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />

<small>PIXIE GAMES</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;What</span> did you think of wearing?&#8221; asked the Giant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see,&#8221; said Peggy. &#8220;Yes&mdash;I think I wish to go
as a Fairy, in pink. What would <i>you</i> like to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The wishes do work well now!&#8221; said the Giant in a
gratified voice, for Peggy stood before him glittering in a
rosy spangled frock and gleaming silver wings, with a star
on her forehead and a wand in her hand all complete.
&#8220;Well, if you&#8217;ll really be so kind as to use up another wish
on me, I think I&#8217;d rather like to go as Little Boy Blue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly!&#8221; said Peggy, and the next instant the
Giant, a good deal smaller than usual, and dressed all in
blue, with a golden horn in his hand, stood on the plain.
Unfortunately, however, his seven-leagued boots still
remained their usual size, and his beard was as long and
curly as ever, which gave him rather a strange appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Not</i> quite so successful,&#8221; he remarked, glancing down
at himself. &#8220;However, I shall pass in a crowd, I daresay.
And now we <i>must</i> start. The Pixies will go under the hills,
which takes a quarter of the time, but I daren&#8217;t take you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
that way for fear of spoiling our clothes. Come along&mdash;fly
on to my shoulder. That&#8217;s right! Shut your eyes and it
won&#8217;t seem so far.&#8221; And off he walked at a great pace over
the hills.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus060.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">Peggy didn&#8217;t mean to do another picture of the fifth
Adventure, but Mother particularly wanted one of the
Pixies, so she had to do this, as the Ball-room one was
too difficult to do. The Pixies are just shouting out, &#8220;This
is Mazing, this is!&#8221; and Peggy is trying to catch two of them.
You can see how tired and giddy the Giant must have
got with wandering about amongst so many Snowmen.
He is just wiping his face with his red handkerchief.
Peggy made herself so <span class="u">very</span> ugly by mistake, and didn&#8217;t
know how to change it.</p>


<p>&#8220;<i>Do</i> try to remember as we go what &#8216;Mazing&#8217; means,&#8221;
said Peggy. &#8220;I wish I knew. It&#8217;s such a funny word!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t talk or think of anything at present,&#8221; said the
Giant. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to try and find my way, and it&#8217;s no easy
matter, I can assure you.&#8221; And a long silence ensued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t we there <i>yet</i>?&#8221; asked Peggy at last, after they
had been travelling for over a quarter of an hour. She
opened her eyes as she spoke, and then nearly fell off the
Giant&#8217;s shoulder with astonishment.</p>

<p>For the brown hills had quite disappeared, and in their
place a dazzling white country spread around. And a
country filled with&mdash;<i>could</i> it be? Peggy rubbed her eyes,
and stared again. Yes. Filled with <i>snowmen</i>! Snowmen
towering up in all directions, one behind the other, hundreds
and hundreds of them, and all exactly like the one Mother
and Peggy had made in the garden last winter, with coals
for eyes, and pipes in their mouths!</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I thought you&#8217;d be surprised!&#8221; said the Giant,
stopping wearily. &#8220;I was. We&#8217;ve missed our way somehow,
I believe, and it would really have been better if we <i>had</i>
gone under the hills after all. This white country gets
on my nerves. I <i>must</i> have a rest!&#8221;</p>

<p>He propped himself up against one of the snowmen as
he spoke, and mopped his face with his red pocket-handkerchief.
&#8220;Do fly up fairly high and see if there&#8217;s any way
out of this,&#8221; he implored in an exhausted voice. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
walking in and out between the wretched things for <i>ages</i>.
There seems no end to them!&#8221;</p>


<p>Peggy fluttered up and looked North, South, East and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
West, but alas, there was nothing but hosts and hosts of
snowmen in all directions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe it&#8217;s a trick of those nasty Pixies!&#8221; said the
Giant angrily when she returned. &#8220;There&mdash;look! Wasn&#8217;t
that one of them?&#8221; and he pointed behind her.</p>

<p>Peggy wheeled round, just in time to see a mischievous
Pixie face peeping from behind a snowman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Catch him!&#8221; cried the Giant, making a grab and
missing. &#8220;Oh, now he&#8217;s over there!&#8221; as another face
peeped at them from quite another direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Mazing, this is,&#8221; said a tiny, chuckling voice,
and a third Pixie appeared round another snowman, and
disappeared again just as Peggy thought she had really got
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear!&#8221; said the Giant, stopping in dismay.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember you said you wished you knew what
Mazing was? I never took in that it was a wish till this
moment!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, so I did!&#8221; said Peggy. &#8220;Gracious me, what a
silly game! and that makes four wishes gone, too. There,
<i>now</i> I&#8217;ve got him!&#8221; and she made a wild dash to the right,
but only succeeded in catching a pointed cap, and falling
full length in the wet snow.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Mazing, this is!&#8221; cried out about twenty
giggling voices at once, and heads poked out from behind
the snowmen in all directions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t stand this any longer,&#8221; said Peggy. &#8220;I
wish we were at that party! <i>Any</i> of the other amusements
would be better than this one!&#8221;</p>

<p>At once the snowmen all toppled over and melted in a
trice, and Peggy and the Giant found themselves standing
in a great Purple Cave full of rosy light.</p>

<p>All around them danced a multitude of Gnomes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Brownies, Sprites, and every other kind of unusual creature;
and a large company of Pixies in fancy dress, who had been
playing leap-frog in a corner, came pushing their way
through the crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you <i>are</i> late!&#8221; they cried. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been Mazing,
haven&#8217;t you?&#8221; and they all burst into a great roar of
laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not being a bit funny,&#8221; said the Giant, turning
his back on them, and &#8220;Here come the Naiads!&#8221; he
whispered to Peggy. &#8220;They only attend the <i>best</i> parties,&#8221;
and he pointed towards some beautiful tall ladies in green
and blue with water lilies in their hair, who were walking
up the cave towards them, followed by a crowd of handsome
Dryads in brown and yellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and play at Flitting,&#8221; said one of them, taking
Peggy&#8217;s and the Giant&#8217;s hands. &#8220;Those bad-mannered
creatures will improve if you take no notice of them. We&#8217;ll
show you how to play,&#8221; and up to the ceiling they all went,
and everyone else after them.</p>

<p>Peggy never forgot that wonderful night. When she
was tired with darting round the cavern walls, or hunting
for diamonds in the dark, she skated with a company of
very polite Trolls in a beautiful inner cavern, whose walls
were a gleaming mass of rubies. And then the Pixies, who
by this time had remembered their manners, crowned her
Queen of the Revels with great pomp, and led her off to
partake of light refreshments.</p>

<p>These were set out in a great black and yellow cavern
which was entirely lighted by glow-worms, cleverly concealed
in full-blown yellow roses hung from the roof. Peggy was
put at the head of the table with the Giant by her side, and
big sugar sweets of every shape and kind were piled upon
their plates.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>But no sooner had they finished half their helpings
than a sudden shout of &#8220;Back to work!&#8221; &#8220;Back to work!&#8221;
sounded from all sides.</p>

<p>The Naiads and Dryads immediately disappeared in a
pale green mist, the Sprites changed into blue smoke, and
the next instant Peggy found herself, with hundreds of
silent, hardworking Pixies, digging with pickaxes in the
sides of a cold dark rock, by the light of a solitary glow-worm!</p>

<p>The Giant, with his blue sleeves rolled up, was working
diligently by her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what <i>are</i> we doing? Where&#8217;s the party gone?&#8221;
cried Peggy in great distress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Over,&#8221; said the Giant without stopping; and at every
blow of his axe great pieces of gold fell out of the rock.
&#8220;<i>Now</i> we&#8217;ve got to work!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but this <i>is</i> dull,&#8221; said Peggy. &#8220;And I know
Nannie wouldn&#8217;t like me to get hot with my bad cold,&#8221; she
went on primly, quite forgetting that she had not thought
of that at all, during the games just now. Then seeing the
Giant was busily knocking some emeralds out of the rock
without taking any notice of what she said, &#8220;Oh, I hate
the horrid place; I wish I was back in bed!&#8221; she went on
crossly, just to see whether he&#8217;d answer that or not, and
throwing her pickaxe down with a crash....</p>

<p>&#8220;But you <i>are</i>, Miss Peggy,&#8221; said Nurse&#8217;s voice
soothingly, and Peggy found herself once more in the
nursery, with the blankets and sheets all tumbling off
in a most uncomfortable way. &#8220;There, that&#8217;s better!
Now you must try and go to sleep again. The hot-water
bottle&#8217;s just tumbled out. I expect that&#8217;s what
woke you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Nannie, I didn&#8217;t <i>really</i> mean to come back so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
soon!&#8221; said Peggy. &#8220;I never thanked them for my nice
time, or anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been dreaming you were at the party next
door,&#8221; said Nurse. &#8220;That&#8217;s because you heard the music,
I expect. Now you mustn&#8217;t talk any longer. To-morrow
night Mother will be home!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, so she will! Good-night, Giant dear,&#8221; said
Peggy, and turning over fell sound asleep at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;She must be feverish, I&#8217;m afraid, yet she <i>looks</i> quite
well,&#8221; said Nurse rather uneasily, stealing softly from the
room.</p>

<p>And all night long on Peggy&#8217;s thumb the green stone
winked and twinkled at the fire.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>THE LAST ADVENTURE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;I wish</span> it wasn&#8217;t such a wet day,&#8221; said Peggy, lying full
length in the loft amongst the hay, and looking through the
cobwebby little window at the driving rain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what does the rain matter?&#8221; asked the Giant,
coming through the roof, and lying down in the hay, too,
with both legs dangling out of the trap-door. And the
sunshine poured through the hole he had made, and a big
patch of blue sky gleamed above it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear!&#8221; said Peggy, &#8220;I never noticed I had the
Ring on! What waste of a wish! The garden boy said
it was going to clear in half an hour anyway. Nannie
thinks I&#8217;m in the garden,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;but I ran up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
here out of the rain. Hadn&#8217;t we better go out again
now it&#8217;s stopped?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>do</i> let&#8217;s stop here for a bit,&#8221; said the Giant.
&#8220;I&#8217;m so stiff from yesterday&#8217;s digging. I stayed on and
did a lot after you&#8217;d gone. Look here,&#8221; and he pulled
handfuls of glittering red and green stones out of his
pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to go off suddenly like that,&#8221; said
Peggy rather shamefacedly. &#8220;I hope you thanked the
Pixies for us both?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, that was all right,&#8221; said the Giant, scooping
together all the hay within reach and making it into a
pillow for his head. &#8220;By the way,&#8221; he went on lazily,
staring up at the dusty beams, &#8220;do you realise this is
our last adventure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, so it is!&#8221; said Peggy with a gasp. &#8220;Oh, how
<i>awful</i>! I can&#8217;t bear to think I shan&#8217;t see you again,&#8221;
and she caught hold of the Giant&#8217;s little finger and hugged
it hard. &#8220;What <i>shall</i> I do without you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you must think of something very exciting
indeed for our last day,&#8221; said the Giant. &#8220;And don&#8217;t
go wasting wishes like you&#8217;ve been doing lately. It
spoils all the fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The thing that puzzles me,&#8221; said Peggy, looking at
her Ring as it gleamed and sparkled in that dark place,
&#8220;is how much the Ring does, and how much you do?
And why sometimes it doesn&#8217;t work till it&#8217;s turned, and
why you can&#8217;t always bring me back without my having
to use up a wish, and where you live when you&#8217;re not
here, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of all the inquisitive children you absolutely take
the cake!&#8221; said the Giant. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve been asked
so many questions for the last five hundred years at least.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
I haven&#8217;t the slightest intention of answering one of them.
Instead of being grateful for having so many wishes at a
time, you begin grumbling&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Giant, darling, I didn&#8217;t <i>mean</i> to grumble!&#8221; cried
Peggy. &#8220;I was only <i>wondering</i>. But I won&#8217;t ask any
more questions, I promise you, if you&#8217;ll only think of some
lovely exciting adventure for to-day. You think of such
<i>beautiful</i> things always,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all very well!&#8221; said the Giant, but his voice
sounded rather pleased. &#8220;Well now, let me see. This
takes some thinking. What <i>was</i> it that that child and I did
in 1350 or thereabouts? Oh yes, I remember. She wished
all her toys to come alive. How would you like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Perhaps</i> it would be rather fun,&#8221; said Peggy&mdash;and
she wished it, but in rather a doubtful voice. &#8220;You&#8217;re sure
it will be really exciting?&#8221; she asked....</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to all that trampling,&#8221; said the Giant in reply,
nibbling at a straw and blinking at the rafters.</p>

<p>Peggy raced to the loft door and looked down into the
yard below, where an extraordinary sight met her eyes.
For the whole place had suddenly become packed from end
to end with every kind of animal, bird and insect, all rushing
to and fro in the greatest state of excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>do</i> look down!&#8221; Peggy implored the Giant.
&#8220;Where <i>can</i> they all have come from? There&#8217;s a camel,
I&#8217;m sure. Oh, and there&#8217;s a lion going right off into the
rose bed! What <i>will</i> John say? And there&#8217;s a funny old
man in a long coat running about amongst them all!
Who <i>can</i> he be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Noah,&#8221; answered the Giant, &#8220;and it&#8217;s all the animals
from your Noah&#8217;s Ark, of course. My word, you&#8217;ll have a
lively time getting &#8217;em in again! You&#8217;d better go down,
I think.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>Peggy ran down the steps, and Noah at once bustled
up to her in a great state of mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;This coat of mine hampers me dreadfully,&#8221; he panted.
&#8220;Do you think you could restore any kind of order? The
tigers have got into the kitchen garden, and a dromedary
and one, if not <i>both</i>, the leopards, have gone down the high
road towards the village!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Giant, Giant, come and help!&#8221; shouted Peggy,
and the next moment the Giant was standing by
her side, shaking pieces of hay off himself, which the few
remaining animals immediately ate.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wants us to drive them up into the nursery
again,&#8221; said Peggy. &#8220;You go that way,&#8221; and she pointed
through the open gate into the kitchen garden, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll
go round the house and get them out of the flower beds.
And you,&#8221; to Noah, &#8220;run down the road after them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chuck, chuck, chuck,&#8221; she went on to a pair of red
storks strutting to and fro in the perennial border, but they
simply flew on to the top of the house and stared down at
her; whilst an elephant, standing in the asparagus bed on
the other side of the garden wall, chose at that moment to
trumpet loudly, and nearly startled Peggy out of her wits.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how we&#8217;re to manage it!&#8221; she said at
last to Noah, who reappeared driving a bright blue pig and
a dromedary up the road. &#8220;It&#8217;s <i>no</i> fun, is it? I only wish
we could all go for a ride or something exciting! How
about that animal there?&#8221; and she pointed at a Giraffe
engaged at the moment in licking a red creeper off one
side of the house....</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold me tight!&#8221; said Noah very nervously, as they
all three found themselves on the Giraffe&#8217;s back and going
at a brisk trot down the back drive. &#8220;<i>Do</i> hold me tight!
I haven&#8217;t ridden for years.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>&#8220;How lovely this is!&#8221; said Peggy, taking a firmer grip
of Noah, who sat in front, and looking back at the Giant.
&#8220;Are you all right?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;At present I am,&#8221; he answered carefully, &#8220;though I
really ought to have been in front for the weight, I suppose.
Hulloa! What&#8217;s he doing now?&#8221;</p>

<p>For the Giraffe had no sooner turned into the high road
than he began to proceed in a series of jumps, all four feet
pressed close together, and rising a good deal higher than
the hedges at each effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him to <i>stop</i>, Noah!&#8221; gasped Peggy. &#8220;You&#8217;re in
front. Hurry up! I&#8217;m shaken to bits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no good,&#8221; moaned Noah. &#8220;I have, and he won&#8217;t
listen. Oh, if we only had some reins!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must <i>wish</i> him to go slower,&#8221; said the Giant to
Peggy in a faint voice. &#8220;I shall die if this goes on! It&#8217;s
all your fault for saying &#8216;or something exciting&#8217; after your
wish. I forgot to tell you how very risky that was. Ah,
thank you! That&#8217;s better,&#8221; for Peggy had wished, and the
Giraffe at once quieted down into a walk&mdash;in fact into
such a slow walk that it almost might have been called
standing still.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get on!&#8221; said Peggy, digging her heels into the Giraffe&#8217;s
back&mdash;but he went slower and slower still.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear, you&#8217;ll have to get off and push, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221;
she said to the Giant. &#8220;We shall never get anywhere at all
if you don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not going to waste another wish on the
horrid old thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the Giant, getting off&mdash;but the more he
pushed the slower the Giraffe went.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, here we are at the village!&#8221; cried Peggy, as after
half an hour&#8217;s steady pushing they turned a corner and saw a
row of cottages stretching down the road on either side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
&#8220;Now get on again,&#8221; she said to the hot and tired Giant, &#8220;and
we&#8217;ll ride grandly down to the shop and buy a pennyworth
of sweets!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s to buy them?&#8221; asked the Giant, wearily settling
himself on the Giraffe&#8217;s back again (it was quite easy to get on
and off because the creature really went so very slowly). &#8220;<i>I</i>
can&#8217;t. I only frighten people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Noah will&mdash;won&#8217;t you, Noah?&#8221; asked Peggy coaxingly.
&#8220;<i>I</i> can&#8217;t, because I&#8217;ve no pennies left at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I haven&#8217;t a farthing on me either,&#8221; said Noah
uncomfortably.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, never mind, have it entered!&#8221; said Peggy, pushing
him off the Giraffe&#8217;s back. &#8220;Run along; we shan&#8217;t move far
from here before you come back&mdash;and get acid drops if
you can,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>Noah obediently crossed the road and walked into the
shop; and about one minute afterwards he reappeared,
bearing two enormous bottles of pear-drops under each arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gracious me!&#8221; cried Peggy, jumping off the Giraffe,
and followed by the Giant. &#8220;How quick you&#8217;ve been! And
that&#8217;s not a pennyworth!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it isn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Noah. &#8220;But the woman <i>made</i>
me take them. I asked her quite politely for a pennyworth,
but instead of weighing them out like anyone else would, she
fell down behind the counter and screamed, &#8216;Take anything
you like, only go away!&#8217; So I did. I chose <i>all</i> pear-drops
because they&#8217;re my favourite sweets,&#8221; he added simply,
putting two into his mouth at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh you greedy!&#8221; cried Peggy. &#8220;Give us some at
once! I&#8217;m very glad nobody sees us,&#8221; she added, looking
anxiously up and down the village street; &#8220;they&#8217;d never
believe the woman really <i>gave</i> them to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And at that moment a perfect shout of delight rose up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
in the road behind them, and Peggy, turning hastily round,
saw a troup of Toys rushing towards them!</p>

<p>There were all the dolls she had ever had, all the people
in every Fairybook she had ever looked at, and all her
wooden carts and horses. There were all her Golliwogs and
Teddy-bears, all the Ark animals again, all the rest of Noah&#8217;s
family (who had been lost for years), all the dolls&#8217; tea-sets,
and even the big dolls&#8217; house, and the rocking-horse, and all
the balls and tops, and ninepins, and whips, and whistles, in
fact every single thing that had ever lived in the Toy
Cupboard in the Nursery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Found at last!&#8221; they screamed, dancing and leaping
round Peggy. &#8220;Now let&#8217;s play a game. <i>You</i> choose!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>THE NICEST WISH OF ALL</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the Toys crowded round, filling the village street
from end to end, Peggy could tell in a moment that they
were ready for any fun or mischief she could possibly wish
for; and her spirits rose higher and higher. She threw all the
pear-drops amongst them, and whilst they were scrambling
about picking them up&mdash;&#8220;I know!&#8221; she cried, as a lovely
thought struck her. &#8220;I wish that the village was our very
own, and that the Giant and I were King and Queen, with
the shop for our palace!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; shouted all the Toys. &#8220;Let&#8217;s turn the
people out now!&#8221; and the Dolls and Golliwogs leading the
way, they rushed up to the doors of the cottages, and banged
on them with all their might.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus072.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">This is the way they rode through the Village in the Sixth
Adventure, and Peggy was very sorry there were not more
people looking out to see them. She is just asking Noah to
get down and buy a pennyworth of sweets. The girl with
the fat face in the bedroom window was the shopwoman&#8217;s
daughter. She ran down the stairs and out of the back
door as fast as she could tear. You can see how slowly
the Giraffe was walking. Afterwards he played about just like
all the other Animals. The Giant was making that funny face
because he felt shy. This was the best Adventure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t be rude to the people, remember!&#8221; cried
Peggy. &#8220;Just ask them to lend us the village for a little
while, and we promise not to hurt it. I expect they&#8217;ll
understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether they did or not Peggy never found out, for
after one glance out of their windows, the people snatched up
their babies, and, screaming to the rest of their children to
follow, they rushed out of the back doors and down the fields
and away over the hills as fast as their legs could carry them.
Peggy tried shouting to them that it was all right, and that
no one would hurt them, and the lions and tigers were very
anxious to run after them, and <i>make</i> them see how silly they
were; but everyone else thought it better to begin playing
at once, before the men came back from work.</p>

<p>Peggy and the Giant&mdash;who suddenly noticed that they
were wearing beautiful scarlet robes, and had heavy gold
crowns on their heads&mdash;went behind the counter in the little
shop, and sold sweets to every Toy who came to buy.
And it was all more fun than words can say, especially when
the dolls, who wanted to play at housekeeping, came crowding
in asking for flour and sugar and rice and all sorts of things.</p>

<p>The Giant, quite doubled up in such a small space,
handed down the jars and tins to Peggy, and she measured
out all the things very carefully, and put them into paper
bags; whilst Noah and his family busied themselves with
getting tea ready in the back room.</p>

<p>Outside, the Golliwogs and Teddy-bears, shouting and
hallooing, led the Ark animals to the pond to drink, or shut
them up in the fields, or harnessed them to the carts they
found, and drove them to market&mdash;and of course the
animals simply <i>loved</i> it.</p>

<p>The rocking-horse got off his rockers, and was put in a
real stable, and given real hay to eat; and the dolls&#8217; house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
was put alongside a real house and had a creeper trained up
it, and instead of the whole of the front wall having to be
undone before people could get in, the little brown door
opened and shut just like one in a real house does.</p>

<p>As for the tops and ninepins, dominoes and other small
fry, they just spun and hopped up and down the road and in
and out of the houses, not really playing at anything, but
enjoying it all as much as anyone. And the pictures in the
story-books took no notice of anybody, but went for long
walks in the woods, with their arms round each other&#8217;s
necks, gossiping.</p>

<p>It really was the best adventure of the lot, Peggy and
the Giant agreed, as they sat by their door that afternoon,
the Giant smoking and reading a newspaper, and Peggy
looking down the busy village street. None of the villagers
came back at all, and it really felt as if the whole place was
their very own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even that pump looks exciting, because it&#8217;s <i>ours</i>,&#8221; said
Peggy, &#8220;and if only Mother was home again everything would
be <i>perfect</i>, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you <i>wish</i> she was coming?&#8221; said the
Giant. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got one more wish left still, and she&#8217;ll see you
get home without any help from me or the Ring either!&#8221;</p>

<p>Peggy jumped to her feet and ran down the road. Why
<i>hadn&#8217;t</i> she thought of it before? Round the corner she tore,
away from everyone&#8217;s sight, even the Giant&#8217;s, her heart
beating fast. Then&mdash;&#8220;I wish Mummie was coming now!&#8221;
she said&mdash;and at once a little tiny speck appeared far, far
away on the white road....</p>

<p>And of course the speck turned into a motor, and of
course Mother was inside it.&mdash;And directly <i>that</i> happened,
the Ring flew right off Peggy&#8217;s thumb and completely disappeared&mdash;goodness
knows where.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>&#8220;And did you come to meet me!&#8221; said Mother, jumping
out of the motor and kissing Peggy dozens and dozens of
times. &#8220;You <i>are</i> a nice Pegtop! Weren&#8217;t you frightened
all by yourself on the road?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Mummie, this is <i>much</i> the nicest wish of all,&#8221; gasped
Peggy, as Mother jumped in again with her in her arms, and
they whizzed along down the road. &#8220;Why!&#8221; as they passed
through the village, &#8220;the Toys are all gone and so is the
Giant!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve not answered my question yet, my Peggums,&#8221;
said Mother, pressing her closer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I wasn&#8217;t frightened, Mummie!&#8221; said Peggy,
burying her nose in the bunch of violets pinned to Mother&#8217;s
coat. &#8220;You see, I had my Giant with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, had you?&#8221; said Mother, not looking at all
surprised. &#8220;Then <i>that&#8217;s</i> all right! Good old Giant!&#8221; she
added softly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all perfectly <i>lovely</i>,&#8221; said Mother, that evening
after tea, when Peggy had finished telling her all the
adventures from beginning to end. &#8220;And I&#8217;m going
to write them down for a book. It would be a thousand
pities if the Ring went to another little girl and she
didn&#8217;t know about putting it on her thumb. Think of
the waste!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and it&#8217;s so bad for the Giant, too,&#8221; said Peggy
thoughtfully. &#8220;I mean, him not being <i>used</i> oftener. You
see what mistakes he made sometimes, darling old thing!
I do think the book is a <i>splendid</i> plan, Mummie,&#8221; and she
began to dance round and round the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you shall do the pictures for it!&#8221; said Mother,
dancing round the room too. (She was <i>that</i> sort of Mother.)</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, <i>do</i> you think I could?&#8221; asked Peggy, stopping
short.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you could,&#8221; said Mother. &#8220;Why, you were
there, and know exactly what everything looked like. And
I&#8217;ll help a little when you want me. Let&#8217;s do a bit every day
after tea till it&#8217;s done,&#8221; and she rolled Peggy on the floor and
hugged her.</p>

<p>And so they did.</p>
